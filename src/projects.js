      "Crawling Chaos is a VR game, where you embody Chaos, an unshaped creature set loose to hunt the city of Croix-des-Cendres. The city is governed by the harsh, fire-and-brimstone rhetoric of the church, where outsiders are mistreated and both strangers and monsters are relentlessly hunted. \n\nAs Chaos, you'll need to avoid the Hunters while navigating the city’s rooftops and alleyways to survive.",

    shortDescription:
      "The game was developed by a team of three. It tells the story of a man living in the forest with his daughter. Each day, he ventures out in search of a rare flower that helps keep her illness at bay.\n\nBut the forest is shrouded in darkness and teeming with sinister creatures lurking in the shadows, ready to attack. Be cautious and ensure you retrieve the flower in time or it may be too late to save his daughter.",
